### Problem

One of the most important problems in e-commerce is the correct calculation of the points given to the products after 
sales. The solution to this problem means providing greater customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, prominence 
of the product for the sellers and a seamless shopping experience for the buyers. Another problem is the correct 
ordering of the comments given to the products. Since misleading comments will directly affect the sale of the product,
it will cause both financial loss and loss of customers. In the solution of these 2 basic problems, e-commerce site and
sellers will increase their sales, while customers will complete their purchasing journey without any problems.
